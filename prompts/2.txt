my project folder:

main.py
scripts (directory): variables.py, commits.py (and other files)

in commits,py there is a line:

from scripts.variables import var

in main.py there is a line:

from scripts.variables import var
from scripts.commits import extracting_authors

when I run from main.py, there is no error. but when i run commits.py i get the error: 

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scripts.variables'

how can i control the importing such that it can run when the module is standalone as well as run as a module.

now don't tell me to just put 'from variables import var' instead of 'from scripts.variables import var'
